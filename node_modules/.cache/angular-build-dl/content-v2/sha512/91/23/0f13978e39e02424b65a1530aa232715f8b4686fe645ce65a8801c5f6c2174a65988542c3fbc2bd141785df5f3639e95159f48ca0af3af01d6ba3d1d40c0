badayun, uttar pradesh. He received his initial training from his maternal grand-uncle, ustad nissar hussain khan (1909–1993). He is also the nephew of ustaad ghulam mustafa khan.\r\n   Rashid khan gave his first concert at age eleven, and the following year, 1978, he performed at an itc concert in delhi. In april 1980, when nissar hussain khan moved to the itc sangeet research academy (sra), calcutta, rashid khan also joined the academy at the age of 14. By 1994, he was acknowledged as a musician (a formal process) at the academy.\r\n   Rashid khan includes the slow elaboration in his vilambit khayals in the manner of his maternal grand-uncle and also developed exceptional expertise in the use of sargams and sargam taankari (play on the scale). He is influenced with the style of amir khan and bhimsen joshi.\r\n   He is also a master of the tarang like his guru but sings them in his own manner, preferring the khayal style rather than the instrumental stroke-based style for which nissar hussain was famous. There is no imitation of instrumental tone.\r\n   He has done playback for a number of songs in the bollywood industry and done innumerable number of concerts and live shows. Some his most famous songs are barsaat sawan, assalatul, ae ri mai re, sakhi ri, bhara badara, jheeni re jheeni, allah hi rehem, aaoge jab hum saajna, tore bina more chain nahi and the list is endless!\r\n   He has been honoured with the padma shri in the year 2006.\r\n   He also received the following awards :\r\n   Sangeet natak academy awards (2006)\r\n   Global indian music academy awards (gima)\r\n   Maha sangeet samman award (2012)\r\n   Mirchi music awards (2013)</p>\r\n                              \r\n                           </div>\r\n                       </div>\r\n                   </div>\r\n                   <div class=\"row judge-border-bottom\">\r\n                       <div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n                           <div class=\"ab-md-text\">\r\n                              <img src=\"https://netwoodstars.com/asset/28.webp\" class=\"img-fluid judge-radious\">\r\n                           </div>\r\n                       </div>\r\n                       <div class=\"col-md-9\">\r\n                           <div class=\"ab-md-text\">\r\n                               <h2>Shishir Sharma</h2>\r\n                   \r\n                   <p>He started his journey back in the year 1995 with ‘Swabhimaan’.
